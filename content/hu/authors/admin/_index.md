I am a hardworking, passionate, final year student at Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania, studying for a B.Sc. Honours degree in Computer Science. My main goal is to constantly improve myself professionally and personally as well. As a software developer, I am always looking for solutions for current problems, deficiencies. I am mostly interested in modern probelm solving, software development (web and mobile as well), and artificial intelligence.
